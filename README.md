## Purpose of this repository

This repository contains a collection of low-level design problems along with their solutions. The aim is to provide a comprehensive resource for individuals looking to deepen their understanding of system design concepts. Low-level design focuses on the implementation details of a system, including low level application of design patterns, object interactions, and diagrams. By studying these problems and their solutions, users can gain insights into real-world applications of design principles and patterns, enhancing their ability to create scalable and maintainable software systems.

This repository provides a solution in typescript for each problem. purpose of this repository to learn application of design patterns and principles in real world problems. so language is not a constraint for anyone who wants to learn in any other language.


To create a low-level design (LLD) for a software system, you can follow these common steps:


1. **Understand Requirements**: Review the high-level design and gather detailed requirements to ensure clarity on what needs to be implemented.

2. **Identify Classes and Objects**: Break down the system into classes and objects based on the identified entities. Define the attributes and methods for each class.


3. **Define Relationships**: Establish relationships between classes, such as inheritance, composition, and aggregation. Create UML diagrams if necessary to visualize these relationships.


4. **Detail Methods**: For each class, specify the methods in detail, including:

- Method names
- Parameters
- Return types
- Exception handling
- Method responsibilities


5. **Data Structures**: Choose appropriate data structures for storing and managing data within the classes. Consider performance and memory usage.


6. **State Diagrams**: Create state diagrams to represent the different states of objects and how they transition from one state to another based on events.


7. **Sequence Diagrams**: Develop sequence diagrams to illustrate how objects interact with each other over time, especially for key functionalities.


8. **Error Handling**: Define how errors will be handled within the system, including logging, user notifications, and recovery strategies.


9. **Design Patterns**: Identify and apply relevant design patterns that can help solve common problems in the design, such as Singleton, Factory, or Observer patterns.


10. **Review and Iterate**: Conduct design reviews with stakeholders to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. Iterate on the design based on the feedback received.


11. **Documentation**: Document the low-level design thoroughly, including class diagrams, method specifications, and any other relevant information to guide the implementation phase.

12. **Prepare for Implementation**: Ensure that the design is ready for developers to start coding, with clear guidelines and specifications.


By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive low-level design that serves as a solid foundation for the implementation of your software system.
